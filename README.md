# t4tech materials

Hello fellow organizer! This is a non-exhaustive list of workshop materials from the last year of events put on by t4tech. Most of these materials are supplementary to the presentations given, so in no way are complete in themselves as an entire lesson or workshop. Please feel free to use these, modify them for your own events, and continue sharing :)

And stay tuned for more to be added!
